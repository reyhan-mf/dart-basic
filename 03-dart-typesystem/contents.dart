/*

We can use type inverence with 'var'
EXAMPLE
void() {
var name = 'Reyhan';
var age = 22;
}

final keyword shows you which variables are meant to be read-only
final title = 'Dart Course';
final titleUppercased = title.toUpperCase();
title = "123123" -> CANT DO THIS!

- const keyword is almost similiar to final but performance focused

key points
var -> can be set more than once
final -> can be set only one
const -> compile-time constants

Best Practice
const > final > var
